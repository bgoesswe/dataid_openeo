Git Repository of the master thesis "Designing a Framework gaining Repeatability for the OpenEO platform" by Bernhard Gößwein

It consists of the following parts:

* An extended version of the OpenEO EODC back end driver (https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-openshift-driver) in the openeo-openshift-driver folder

* The reference back end of the OpenEO EODC back end driver (https://github.com/bgoesswein/dataid_openeo/tree/master/reference_back_end) in the reference_back_end folder

* An extended version of the OpenEO Python client (https://github.com/Open-EO/openeo-python-client)in the openeo-python-client folder

The openeo-openshift-driver has to be running and accessible by the machine that runs the openeo-python-client. The execution of the use cases and the evaluation is done with the python client. For re-executing the evaluation the back end in the openeo-openshift-driver as well as the back end in reference_back_end has to be install.

For more detailed information about the parts, visit the folders.
